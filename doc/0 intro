Kryon is a portable C library that implements a synthetic UI filesystem
using the 9P2000 protocol.  It operates in two modes:

    CPU Server Mode    - Linux/Android/BSD with TCP listener
    Native Mode         - 9front with kernel pipes

All UI state is exposed as a filesystem.  Any language that speaks 9P
can build UIs.

Architecture:

    Controller (Lua/Scheme/C/Python/rc)
        ↓ 9P read/write
    Model (9P Filesystem)
        ↓ state changes
    View (Drawterm CPU Server / libdraw Native)

Quick start:

    CPU Server Mode:
        gcc -o kryon kryon.c
        ./kryon --cpu-server --port 17019
        drawterm -h host -a 17019

    Native Mode:
        9kry -m /mnt/kryon &
        lua controller.lua

# Kryon API

Kryon is an ordinary Ziran package. An application imports the modules it
uses; no widget names are recognized by the Ziran compiler or `.zib` loader.
The public package imports are declared in [`ziran.toml`](../ziran.toml).

| Import | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `Kryon` | Geometry, drawing values, sessions, `Text(TextProps)`, and `Button(ButtonProps)` |
| `Widgets` | The core widget catalog, including `Image(ImageProps)`, page structure, fields, controls, layout, and tree input |
| `Page`, `Semantic` | Direct page and semantic-kind exports for document-oriented applications |
| `PageRoute` | Browser route path, hash, and history (`GetRoutePath`, `PushRoute`, ...) for Canvas and DOM profiles |
| `geometry`, `drawing_props`, `session`, `tree`, `surface`, `paint_queue`, `style`, `style_sheet`, `control_props`, `font_metrics`, `scroll`, `semantic`, `tree_input`, `widget_kind` | Building blocks for widget packages |

## Widget packages

A widget that is not part of the core catalog lives in its own Git package
and depends on Kryon. [Plot](https://github.com/kryonlabs/plot) and
[DataViews](https://github.com/kryonlabs/data-views) are examples. Import
the building blocks by their package-qualified names, so a reader sees which
package each name comes from:

```zi
#import "kryon/session"
#import "kryon/tree"
#import "kryon/surface"
#import "kryon/paint_queue"
```

Tests that need a host bind Kryon's internal capabilities the same way, for
example `--bind kryon/raster_text:RasterText=my_test_host:RasterText` with
`ziran bundle --project`.

Source coloring is the separate [Syntax](https://github.com/ziranlang/syntax)
package. Its `SyntaxColorSpan` has the same fields as `TextAreaColorSpan`.

Hosts with stable font measurements call `font_metrics.GlyphMetricsChanged()`
after initializing their font services and whenever fonts or their advances
change. This lets `TextArea` retain wrapped rows in a bounded cache of owned
content. Publish revisions on the UI's owning thread. The pixmap host enables
reuse automatically for its bundled, fixed
font outlines. Hosts that have not published a metrics revision keep measuring
rows on each call; they do not acquire an invalidation requirement implicitly.
Font size, typeface, wrap width and content changes always select a new layout.

## Style rules

`InstallStyleRules` copies typeface text into Kryon-owned storage and returns
`false` without replacing the active rules when the rule count is outside
`0..320` or the combined typeface text exceeds 65,536 bytes.
`InstallParsedStyleRules` reports the same storage failure.

Use `Image(ImageProps)` for UI images. Its asset path, bounds, fit, and alt
text describe the image at the widget boundary. Backend texture calls are
renderer primitives, not alternate widget APIs.

An application using a Kryon host exports a Ziran function with this shape:

```zi
using UI :: #import "Widgets";

#program_export
Frame :: (session: Session, viewport: Rectangle) -> s32 {
    label: TextProps
    label.text = "Hello, Kryon"
    Text(session, label)
    return 0
}
```

The selected host owns the process entry point, calls `BeginFrame` and
`EndFrame`, supplies input to the session, and presents paint operations.
Every host reports the same key codes through `KeyboardTake`: letters as
uppercase ASCII and named keys as `KeyEnter`, `KeyBackspace`, `KeyLeft`, and
the other `Key` constants. `TypedTextTake` collects the text typed since the
last frame, and `TextFieldInputFor(key, modifiers, text)` turns both into a
focused `TextField`'s input.
Application code owns its product state and calls widgets within `Frame`.
The complete manifest and build commands are in [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md).

Individual `.zi` modules under [`src/ui`](../src/ui) can also be imported by
non-graphical Ziran programs. A program that does not import Kryon uses no
Kryon code. A portable `.zib` links only imported modules and needs a host
binding for any platform effect they call.

An application that runs another `.zib` inside its own window draws that
bundle's widgets with [`widget_host`](../src/backend/widget_host.zi). The
bundle calls each widget's `HostedHost` function; the host binds
`WidgetHostCall` for the functions `WidgetHostSupports` lists, and wraps each
bundle frame in `WidgetHostBegin(session, asset_allowed)` and
`WidgetHostEnd()`. The callback decides which asset paths the bundle may
draw; texture handles never cross. Records match fields by name, so a bundle
and its host may be built against different Kryon layouts.
[`scripts/generate-widget-codecs.py`](../scripts/generate-widget-codecs.py)
generates the codecs for Kryon's widget records and, with `--uses`, for an
application's own records.

[`src/ui/modules.txt`](../src/ui/modules.txt) is the core build inventory.
`make test` checks source, saved `.zir`, `.zib`, and generated C/C++/Go behavior.

# Hello World

Welcome to Kryon's markdown support!

This is a simple example demonstrating basic markdown features.

## What is Kryon?

Kryon is a cross-platform UI framework with native markdown support. You can write markdown files and run them directly:

```bash
kryon run hello_world.md
```

The markdown is parsed into Kryon's IR (Intermediate Representation) and rendered using the same engine that powers `.kry`, `.nim`, and `.tsx` frontends.

## Features

- **Fast**: Native markdown parsing in C
- **Cross-platform**: Renders on desktop (SDL3), terminal, and web
- **Integrated**: Mermaid diagrams become native Flowchart components
- **Flexible**: Embed markdown in `.kry` files or run standalone

**Try editing this file and re-running `kryon run hello_world.md`!**

Const and const_for is not working currently as it shoulD

variable such as var or in state of counters are reactive so they get stored as references and then get evaluated at runtime.

const and const_for expansions happen at compile time and are never stored as references, as they are lawys the same value, you must identify the issues why the example files column_alignments.kry and const_expression_test.kry are not working currently.

Criteria of success:

1) if column_alignments launches correctly with raylib with no error
2) const_expression_test launches correctly with raylib ith no error, also check that the the evalution is correct, we have a containerWidth / 2. this Means the container width from the const, in no case sholud it ever be the screen width, we do not want any fallbacks


Improtant:
do not implemnet any hacks, fallbacks, backwards compatiblity etc.. I always want a clean implemntatino without any baggage.

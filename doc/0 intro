INTRO

Kryon is a portable C library that implements a synthetic UI filesystem
using the 9P2000 protocol. It functions as a system-level window manager
(rio replacement) for 9front, providing both structured widgets and legacy
draw(3) compatibility.

OPERATING MODES

Kryon operates in two modes:

    CPU Server Mode    - Linux/Android/BSD with TCP listener
    Native Mode         - 9front with kernel pipes

All UI state is exposed as a filesystem.  Any language that speaks 9P
can build UIs.

ARCHITECTURE

As a window manager, Kryon provides:

    Controller (Lua/Scheme/C/Python/rc)
        ↓ 9P read/write
    Model (9P Filesystem at /mnt/wm)
        ↓ state changes
    View (Drawterm CPU Server / libdraw Native)

KEY FEATURES

Kryon evolves rio's "dumb rectangle" model:

1. Structured UI - Widgets (buttons, menus, layouts) with state
2. Draw Proxy - Transparent draw(3) compatibility for legacy apps
3. Filesystem Control - All operations via /mnt/wm/... files
4. Hybrid Rendering - Mix widgets and raw pixels in same window

Quick start:

    CPU Server Mode:
        gcc -o kryon kryon.c
        ./kryon --cpu-server --port 17019
        drawterm -h host -a 17019

    Native Mode:
        9kry -m /mnt/wm &
        lua controller.lua
